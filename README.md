# homebrew-warwick
Homebrew tap for HEP software at Warwick:

- HEP specific packages
- Custom versions of `homebrew-{core,science,hep}` Formulae

To use as the main repo, do

```console
$ brew tap drbenmorgan/warwick
$ brew tap-pin drbenmorgan/warwick
```

Without any tap specifier, formulae should be looked for first in this tap.
